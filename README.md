# AHIRv2-Hardware-Designs
AHIRv2 is a tool-chain developed by Prof.MPD and his team at IIT Bombay. </br>
The tool-chain is capable of converting algorithms written in high level language to synthesizable RTL description (VHDL code).
It can also verify the synthesized hardware using C-testbench. </br>

This repository contains some hardware descriptions described using Algorithmic Assembly (Aa) Language. </br>
Several of these are examples or assignments provided as part of the course EE789 at IITB, while few are out of sheer desire to play around.
